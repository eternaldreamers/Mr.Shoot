# Linear Algebra

## Setting up the Environment

- We are using conda to manage our dependencies.

#### Create the Conda Environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### Activate the Environment
Once the environment is set up, you can activate it with:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

You should now have all the libraries and dependencies needed to work on the project.
